# Home Server

_Documenting my process figuring out how to set up a home server that meets my automation needs, using old hardware where possible_

## Requirements

1. Serve as local NAS, mainly for media storage (photos, videos, music, code)
2. Serve as a backup server, backing up data on both local RAID (or equivalent) as well as external drives
3. Serve as a development/web server capable of running docker, VMs, and so on
4. Run Octoprint to manage 3d printer remotely

Additionally, would be nice to have:

5. Ability to run PiHole and other utility software usually deployed standalone
6. Use as media/streaming server to stream media to TV and other devices
7. Use to manage smart home devices, if any
8. Use for IT purposes like deployment/recovery/update management on home PC
9. Use as cache for assets like NPM packages, Steam games etc. on demand (eg. to prepare for a LAN party)
10. Offload computational tasks like rendering/encoding video from main PC
